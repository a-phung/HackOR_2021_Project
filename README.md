# COVID Clarified

COVID Clarified is a web app developed by Team 41 of the [HackOR 2021 hackathon](https://hackor.org/) to create a one-stop information hub for COVID-19, citing trusted and verified sources for every state in the US. Our mission was to increase awareness around COVID-19 topics, such as case counts, vaccine information, and best health practices.

We wanted to know how we could...
- increase awareness about COVID guidelines, numbers, and vaccine information,
- educate others on the science behind vaccines and health guidelines,
- keep track of the different reopening and vaccine eligibility phases for different states and counties,
- and help find appointments for more people to make steps towards herd immunity in the US.
